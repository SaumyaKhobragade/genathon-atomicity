## About

We consume a flood of content (articles, videos, posts, PDFs), but later often struggle to recall "that one great thing we read." Sparky captures browsing context, enriches content with AI-generated summaries, tags and sentiment, and provides a simple dashboard to browse and search your personal memories.

### Bridge Not Connecting?

1. Must be on `localhost:3000`
2. Reload extension
3. Check manifest permissions
4. Look for bridge messages in console

### Summary Same as Content?

**Fixed!** Reload extension to get new summary algorithm.
